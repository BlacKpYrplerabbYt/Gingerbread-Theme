	 ************************* README *************************
	 * 
	 * This is very basic at this stage. 
	 * A lot will be added.
	 * 
	 * Themes are intended to be very simple to use. 
	 * A lot of progress is being done to add new enhancements
	 * and as such, you may need to update your themes in future versions.
	 * The goal is to prevent any breakage.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Br0tip: Use this activity to update the test device.
	 **********************************************************
	 * 
	 * Manifest:
	 * You MUST have the following in your manifest to be seen:
	 * 
	 * <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
     * <category android:name="org.enate.BESTApp.Theme" />
	 * 
	 **********************************************************
	 * 
	 * Drawables:
	 * Overwrite the images included, they will drop in automatically.
	 * If you remove an image, the widget will default to Sense for each missing image.
	 * 
	 * Some notes:
	 * 	Due to limitations, I can't (for now at least) get the ListView bg to tile
	 * 	The drw_blank_tile is used for enforcing the button sizes (long story..)
	 * 		Change that, all the buttons change sizes too.
	 *
	 **********************************************************
	 * 
	 * Strings:
	 * Set the theme title, description and other text
	 * 
	 **********************************************************
	 * 
	 * Colors:
	 * Set the colors for different components.
	 *
